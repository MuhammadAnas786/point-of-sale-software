ElectronJS first project for a local business that i made in 2019
Not Complete tho!
I used Electron js framework on node js as backend and simple html as frontEnd.
Embedded DB Sqlite3 with library knex.js
To run it write following commands in cmnd prompt/Terminal
# npm install
# npm run postinstall
# electron .
Now you are good to go
